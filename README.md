# PDF to Audio convertor

## To use this program you need to install two libraries:

### 1. pyttsx : pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python.It works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
#### Type this in your Command Prompt to install the library - 'pip install --user pyttsx'

### 2. PyPDF2 : A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of:
####            extracting document information (title, author, â€¦)
####            splitting documents page by page
####            merging documents page by page
####            cropping pages
####            merging multiple pages into a single page
####            encrypting and decrypting PDF files
####            and more!
####            By being Pure-Python, it should run on any Python platform without any dependencies on external libraries. It can also work entirely on StringIO objects rather ####            than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory. It is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate PDFs.
#### Type this in your Command Prompt to install the library - 'pip install --user 'PyPDF2'
